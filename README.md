### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Im Nelly SÃ©lem
I'm starting my lab at CCM. Iâ€™m interested in developing bioinformatic tools to study microorganismâ€™s comparative genomics and evolution. The lab philosophy is the Charles Gordon's always valid thought:  "We are all smart. Disntiguish yourself for being kind. " 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on metapangenomics. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning by teaching metagenomics and pangenomics tools.
- ðŸ‘¯ I love collaborative work. As an example here is our [Metagenomics lesson](https://nselem.github.io/metagenomics-workshop/) and the [Pangenome Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-genome).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with wetlab.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about bioinformatics education

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She
- âš¡ Fun fact: I always say yes to an skating invitation.

## Additional information
I am a professor at the [Center for Mathematical Sciences](http://matmor.unam.mx/es) in  UNAM in Morelia. I earned a degree in Mathematics from the [University of Guanajuato](https://www.ugto.mx/) and a masterâ€™s degree by [CIMAT](https://www.cimat.mx/). Then, I did a Ph.D. and a Post-doctorate in Integrative Biology at [Evolution of Metabolic Diversity lab](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/Dr-Francisco-Barona) at [Langebio-Cinvestav](https://langebio.cinvestav.mx/). I care about teaching, I have taught at main MÃ©xico Universities: UNAM, ITESM, IPN, and CINVESTAV and I also developed open-source lessons for " [The Carpentries"](https://carpentries.org/). I'm a founder member of[ _BetterLab_](https://www.facebook.com/BetterLab-960854350785766/), a biotechnology and software startup, and I'm also a member of the Mexican SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Consortium. As a scientist, I have proposed and developed bioinformatics solutions to biological problems of comparative genomics of microorganisms. I am interested in the genome evolution of Archaea, Bacteria, and Fungi. For my work, I received the L'orÃ©al award for women in science 2021. To me, everything is teamwork and that is what I expect from my students. Life-work balance it is important, family and social contribution matters to me. I like to skate and share, because of that Iâ€™m a member of the development program [Girls Hockey League](https://www.facebook.com/Girls-Hockey-League-M%C3%A9xico-104021021498610/) Mexico.
